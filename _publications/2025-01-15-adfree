title: "Swipe or Subscribe: Do Young People Really Prefer an Ad-free Instagram?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-01-15-adfree
excerpt: 'This study examines how Generation Z engages with personalised advertising and privacy concerns, focusing on Instagram's new subscription model. An online survey among young people revealed that only 12.5% would be willing to pay for a subscription. Although many of the participants find advertising overwhelming and distracting and express significant concerns about data protection in social media use, neither advertising saturation nor privacy concerns appear to influence their willingness to subscribe.'
