title: "Swipe or subscribe: Do youth really prefer an ad-free Instagram?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-01-01-adfree
excerpt: 'This study examines how Generation Z engages with personalised advertising and privacy concerns, focusing on Instagram's new subscription model. An online survey of 479 young people revealed that only 12.5% would be willing to pay for a subscription. Although many of the participants find advertising over-whelming and distracting and express significant concerns about data protection in social media use, neither advertising saturation nor privacy concerns appear to influence their willingness to subscribe.'
