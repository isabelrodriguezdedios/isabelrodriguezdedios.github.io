excerpt: 'The main goal of this study is to analyse how the type of source and message framing on social media influence message credibility, corporate reputation, and word-of-mouth. An online experiment with 2 (source: influencer vs corporate) x 2 (CSR frame motives: values-driven vs performance-driven) between-subject design was conducted among 200 participants. Results showed that the type of source does not affect message credibility or corporate reputation, but a corporate source generates more word-ofmouth. Moreover, values-driven motives increase corporate reputation and generate more word-of-mouth. However, the type of frame motives does not impact message credibility.'
