title: "Identity implications in the spreading of cultural heritage through the Internet: a study from the framing theory"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-01-01-identity-implications-cultural-heritage-internet
excerpt: 'The aim of this study was to locate the heritage components that receive the greatest coverage on Spanish municipal websites, to then point out the approach that predominates in their characterization, a frame based on the dialectics between the local and the global. With this goal in mind, we performed a content analysis of a sample of 500 websites throughout Spain. In light of the results, it can be postulated that heritage identity in Spain has a religious tenor, as the manifestations most presented are usually ecclesiastical constructions (on the tangible plane) and liturgical events (on an intangible level).'
