excerpt: 'Following  Contact,  Narrative Persuasion,  and  Queer  Intercultural Theories,  two  experiments  were  conducted  among  cisgender  people  to  investigate which types of narratives (positive, neutral, or negative) shared by trans YouTubers are more  effective  for  reducing  prejudice  towards  trans people,  and  whether  this  effect depends on the YouTuber’s gender (Study 1) and/or their ethnic background (Study 2).'
