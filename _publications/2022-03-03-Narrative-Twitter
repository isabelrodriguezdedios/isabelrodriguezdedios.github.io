title: "Effects of narrative-persuasive frames on Twitter regarding blood donation: pride versus empathy and people versus numbers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-03-03-Narrative-Twitter
excerpt: 'This study analyzes the direct and interaction effects of intonation, speech rate, and hand gestures on the speakers’ credibility and effectiveness and the participants’ psychophysiological response (attention and arousal). Results showed that the best combination was a moderate intonation at a medium speech rate with a moderate number of hand gestures. These results supported the so-called Expressive Balance Effect. Speakers must maintain the expressive load of the different nonverbal cues in balance to be more effective and credible and enhance the listeners’ cognitive processing.'
