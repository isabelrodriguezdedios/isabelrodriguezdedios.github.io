excerpt: 'Writing and reading have long been considered to be the two most important skills that pupils must master perfectly. For this reason, written competence has been the protagonist in education, while oral communication via listening and speaking has traditionally remained in the background. Given the lack of data and the importance of oral communication nowadays, the aim of this study is to determine the current weight of oral skills in primary education. For this purpose, 433 teachers answered an online questionnaire to determine the importance of each skill, the work dedicated to each, the activities to develop them, and the students’ perceptions.'
