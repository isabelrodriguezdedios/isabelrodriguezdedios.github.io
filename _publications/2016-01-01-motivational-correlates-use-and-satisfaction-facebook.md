permalink: /publication/2016-01-01-motivational-correlates-use-and-satisfaction-facebook
excerpt: 'This study, linked to the theory of uses and gratifications, analyzes the reasons  for using Facebook and contrasts how  those motives predict behavioral and attitudinal patterns. The questionnaire used, applied to a sample of Spanish students (n=268), included a scale about the reasons to use Facebook, and information on the consumption and satisfaction with 
that social network. An exploratory factorial analysis revealed six motivational dimensions: entertainment, virtual community, relationships maintenance, coolness, companionship and self-expression; the first three are the main reasons of use. Moreover, the search for entertainment showed the stronger statistical relationship with satisfaction with Facebook.'
