2022-01-01	CSR communication on social media: the impact of source and framing on message credibility, corporate reputation and WOM	Corporate Communications: an International Journal	The main goal of this study is to analyse how the type of source and message framing on social media influence message credibility, corporate reputation, and word-of-mouth. An online experiment with 2 (source: influencer vs corporate) x 2 (CSR frame motives: values-driven vs performance-driven) between-subject design was conducted among 200 participants. Results showed that the type of source does not affect message credibility or corporate reputation, but a corporate source generates more word-ofmouth. Moreover, values-driven motives increase corporate reputation and generate more word-of-mouth. However, the type of frame motives does not impact message credibility.

2021-10-01	Competencias de comunicación oral en la educación primaria / Oral communication skills in elementary school	Profesional De La Información	Writing and reading have long been considered to be the two most important skills that pupils must master perfectly. For this reason, written competence has been the protagonist in education, while oral communication via listening and speaking has traditionally remained in the background. Given the lack of data and the importance of oral communication nowadays, the aim of this study is to determine the current weight of oral skills in primary education. For this purpose, 433 teachers answered an online questionnaire to determine the importance of each skill, the work dedicated to each, the activities to develop them, and the students’ perceptions.

2021-02-01	Narrative Persuasion in a Mobile Environment: Effectiveness of a Mobile Application for Promoting Digital Skills and Coping Strategies in Adolescents	International Journal of Communication	Digital skills and coping strategies have emerged as key competences for adolescents because of concerns about online risks and opportunities. A mobile application with narrative content was developed for teaching digital skills and coping strategies. A quasi-experiment conducted among 245 adolescents showed that the application was effective. Its use raised the level of personal security skill and intention to use active coping strategies when facing contact online risks. Identification with the main character and mobile acceptance predicted the impact of the app, but narrative transportation did not. This study suggests that narratives in mobile apps can be effective for adolescents.	Rodríguez-de-Dios, I., Igartua, J. J., & d’Haenens, L. (2021).

2021-01-01	The contact hypothesis during the European refugee crisis: Relating quality and quantity of (in direct intergroup contact to attitudes towards refugees.	Group Processes & Intergroup Relations	This study analyses the relationship between the frequency and valence of direct intergroup contact with people with a migration background, the frequency of indirect contact with news on refugees, and the perception of realistic and symbolic threat, and attitudes towards refugees among adults in four European countries (N = 6,000). Findings indicate that interethnic contact is positively related to attitudes towards refugees. Moreover, valence of direct contact is found to be more important to attitude formation than its frequency. Regarding indirect contact, exposure to news on refugees and public news consumption are positively related to attitudes.	De Coninck, D., Rodríguez-de-Dios, I. & d’Haenens, L. (2021).

2018-05-01	A study of the relationship between parental mediation and adolescents’ digital skills, online risks and online opportunities	Computers in Human Behavior	The first goal of this study was to examine how adolescents' digital skills are related to their online opportunities and online risks behaviours. A second goal was to examine the influence of two ways of parental mediation (active and restrictive) on the level of teenagers’ digital skills, and subsequently their online opportunities and online risks. Finally, we intended to establish the validity and the structure of the Digital Literacy Scale. Using data from a cross-sectional survey of 1.446 Spanish secondary school pupils, we found that more digitally skilled adolescents take more opportunities, and experience more risks. Digital literacy mediates the relationship between restrictive (but not of active) parental mediation and online risks and opportunities. Furthermore, the Digital Literacy Scale was shown to be valid in terms of construct validity.	Rodríguez-de-Dios, I., van Oosten, J. M. F., & Igartua, J.-J. (2018).

2018-01-01	Identity implications in the spreading of cultural heritage through the Internet: a study from the framing theory	Communication & Society	The aim of this study was to locate the heritage components that receive the greatest coverage on Spanish municipal websites, to then point out the approach that predominates in their characterization, a frame based on the dialectics between the local and the global. With this goal in mind, we performed a content analysis of a sample of 500 websites throughout Spain. In light of the results, it can be postulated that heritage identity in Spain has a religious tenor, as the manifestations most presented are usually ecclesiastical constructions (on the tangible plane) and liturgical events (on an intangible level).

El rol mediador de la identificación con el protagonista / Eﬀect of Similarity with the Protagonist of Narratives Against Racism in Attitudes Toward Immigration. The Mediating Role of Identification with the Protagonist	Anuario Electrónico de Estudios en Cominicación Social “Disertaciones”	 The main goal of this experimental study was to generate new knowledge about the processes of narrative persuasion and its application to reduce the prejudice towards highly stigmatized immigrants. We analyzed the eﬀect of similarity between the protagonist of a narrative designed to reduce the prejudice and the audience of the message on the identification with the protagonist and on the attitudes towards immigration. Results showed that similarity positively influenced the identification with the protagonist which, in turn, was associated with more favorable attitudes toward immigrants.	"Igartua, J.

2016-12-01	Skills of Digital Literacy to Address the Risks of Interactive Communication	Journal of Information Technology Research	New technologies are fully integrated into the lives of children, so every day they spend more and more time using them. It is noteworthy that technologies offer many opportunities and benefits for children, but they are also associated with disadvantages and dangers. In this situation, the authors suggest that we should not deprive minors of the use of digital technologies. Nevertheless, the solution is to provide them with digital skills so they become digital literate and can use these tools safely. Therefore, through this study they sought to identify the skills that compound digital literacy: technological or instrumental, communication, information, critical, and security.

2016-01-01	Motivational correlates of use and satisfaction with Facebook	Cuadernos Info	"This study, linked to the theory of uses and gratifications, analyzes the reasons  for using Facebook and contrasts how  those motives predict behavioral and attitudinal patterns. The questionnaire used, applied to a sample of Spanish students (n=268), included a scale about the reasons to use Facebook, and information on the consumption and satisfaction with 
that social network. An exploratory factorial analysis revealed six motivational dimensions: entertainment, virtual community, relationships maintenance, coolness, companionship and self-expression; the first three are the main reasons of use. Moreover, the search for entertainment showed the stronger statistical relationship with satisfaction with Facebook."	Igartua, J.J., & Rodríguez-de-Dios, I. (2016).
