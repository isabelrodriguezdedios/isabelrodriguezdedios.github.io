I am Isabel Rodríguez de Dios (PhD, 2018), a **Postdoctoral Researcher** (Juan de la Cierva-Formación) at [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/es/) (Barcelona). In September 2018 I earned a PhD degree from the University of Salamanca with the thesis entitled 'Risks of interactive communication in adolescents. Digital literacy diagnosis and intervention'. 
Before joining the Pompeu Fabra University, I was a lecturer at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). I have also been a visiting scholar at the [Antwerp Social Lab](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/onderzoeksgroep/antwerp-social-lab/) and [research group MIOS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/mios/) (University of Antwerp), the [Institute for Media Studies](https://soc.kuleuven.be/ims) (KU Leuven) and the [Center for research on Children, Adolescents and the Media](https://www.ccam-ascor.nl/) (Amsterdam School of Communication Research, University of Amsterdam).
My research focuses on adolescents and social media, narrative persuasion, and media psychology. I am a member of the [Communication, Advertising, and Society]( https://www.upf.edu/web/cas) (UPF) and the [Observatory for Audiovisual Contents](http://www.ocausal.es/) (USAL).
